# How to use Markdown:
You can save files written in Markdown with .Markdown or .md as the extension. From there, you need a Markdown application that’s capable of processing the Markdown file.

Markdown applications use a Markdown processor to take the Markdown text and convert it into HTML, which is then viewable on the web. Or, you can export the Markdown into other formats like PDF or Docx.
# Where can Markdown be used?
# The best places to use Markdown include:

# Websites:
Markdown was designed for the web. It’s especially good for straight-forward, text-heavy sites like blogs. It’s also used on websites with a significant amount of user-generated content, like Reddit and Evernote.
Documents and notes: If you want to write a quick note or document without having to stop, reach for your mouse, and click buttons to format, Markdown can come in handy. It’s also handy for writing to-do lists, and several apps support it, including WriteMonkey and SublimeText.
Email: Some email clients (like MailMate and Airmail) support Markdown. You can also write an email in Markdown and export it to your email client or install a browser extension.

HTML provides the structure of web pages. CSS takes things a step further by defining the layout of the page and adding stylistic elements.
